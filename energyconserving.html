    <h1>Does Energy really conserve?</h1>
    <div>
        <p>

            Imagine two bodies identical to Earth are isolated from the entire universe. Let’s call those bodies, <b>LION</b> (L in short) and another body <B>TIGER</B> (T in short) if I am an observer who sits on the body L and observes. I observe Body T at infinity with no effect of gravity on each other because of each other. 
    I observe the body T is moving with velocity V towards L. After some time the body T will enter into the gravitational field of Body L and accelerates from there till they both collide.
        </p>

            Now what is the total energy of the system initially:
        </h3>
        <p>

            As they are not in the gravitational fields of each other the only contribution for energy is due to the motion of the body T.
            So total energy
        </p>

    H = ½ MV^2

    <p>
        Where M=mass of the body T
    </p>

<p>

    After it enters the gravitational field what is the total energy just before collision we can see that  body T accelerates to a higher velocity compared to V let it be U and if R is the radius of the body T and r is the radius of the body L then
</p>

Total energy = ½ MU^2 - GMm/(R+r)
<p>

    Mathematically it might seem that total energy in both scenarios is exactly the same. But I feel there is a problem here. That is we have an increase in velocity which means an increase in kinetic energy, to maintain the total energy to be a constant we have to decrease the energy and we are doing it with potential energy which was not present in the first scenario. This means we have to take a negative energy to compensate for the positive energy. Mathematically we might have to take it as negative based on how we define it. But we have kinetic energy in the second scenario which is higher than the kinetic energy of the first scenario. And we have a potential energy. From this logically can say that we have higher kinetic energy and potential energy in the second scenario which means the total energy of the system has increased from nowhere, (of course under the condition that we take potential energy to be positive)
</p>

    In this case, we can note that energy being constant is not true always. This seems to violate the conservation of energy principle.
